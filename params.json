It was developed by Team CPH at the Computer Science Department of the University of York, as part of a Software Engineering Project.\r\n\r\n### The Game\r\nThe game, designed for two players, involves opponents building railway networks to achieve goals. Players have a set of goals towards which they are working.\r\nPlayers can make this easier by playing Cards to either buff their network or to debuff their opponents. Some cards will provide a temporary speed boost to trains on a network; others will send (un)natural disasters to wreak havoc on the opponents railway!\r\nFeaturing a fully custom user interface, and bespoke voice acting and narration by the inimitable Prof. Colin Runciman.\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nThe source code for the game is available above as a .zip, or via GitHub. The code is PEP8-compliant.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTeam CPH consisted of @HarveyHunt, @FlinnBurgess, @pmb516, @EthanLaBonche, @hwjj500, and @al502. It will be extended by another team (yet to be discovered/revealed/decided/foretold/written in blood across a wall).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
