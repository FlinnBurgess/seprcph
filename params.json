{"name":"Trains Across Europe","tagline":"A turn-based strategy game developed as a Software Engineering Project at the University of York","body":"### Welcome to Trains Across Europe\r\nTrains Across Europe (TaxE) is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game written in Python. It was developed by Team CPH at the Computer Science Department of the University of York, as part of a Software Engineering Project.\r\n\r\n### The Game\r\nThe game, designed for two players, involves opponents building railway networks to achieve goals. Players have a set of goals towards which they are working.\r\nPlayers can make this easier by playing Cards to either buff their network or to debuff their opponents. Some cards will provide a temporary speed boost to trains on a network; others will send (un)natural disasters to wreak havoc on the opponents railway!\r\nFeaturing a fully custom user interface, and bespoke voice acting and narration by the inimitable Prof. Colin Runciman.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nThe current iteration of TaxE is available via the .zip and .tar.gz links to the right. You can also browse the source files via the GitHub link at the top of the page. \r\nBeing written in Python, the game's source code is identical to the game's executable version. As such, all downloads will be playable and modifiable.\r\n\r\n### User Manual\r\nThe user manual for the game will be available as a PDF file here once the game has reached Version 1.0. It will also be included in the GitHub repository. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTeam CPH consisted of @HarveyHunt, @FlinnBurgess, @pmb516, @EthanLaBonche, @hwjj500, and @al502. It will be extended by another team (yet to be discovered/revealed/decided/foretold/written in blood across a wall).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
