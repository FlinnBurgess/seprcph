{"name":"Trains Across Europe","tagline":"A turn-based strategy game developed as a Software Engineering Project at the University of York","body":"### Welcome to Trains Across Europe\r\nTrains Across Europe (TaxE) is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game written in Python. It was developed by Team CPH at the Computer Science Department of the University of York, as part of a Software Engineering Project.\r\n\r\n### The Game\r\nThe game, designed for two players, involves opponents building railway networks to achieve goals. Players have a set of goals towards which they are working.\r\nPlayers can make this easier by playing Cards to either buff their network or to debuff their opponents. Some cards will provide a temporary speed boost to trains on a network; others will send (un)natural disasters to wreak havoc on the opponents railway!\r\n\r\n### Development\r\nTaxE is written in Python, using the PyGame library. Python is a really simple programming language to use, with easily enough power for the project. The use of PyGame means that most of the difficult game-specific code is written already.\r\nWe also made a number of deliberate decisions in our architecture design to make the project more modular, and therefore easy to add to and change.\r\nFor example, the game uses an Event Manager system to handle in-game events. This essentially means that objects subscribe to events which other objects create, and this is all handled through a mediator class called `EventManager`. This is very easy to understand, and equally easy to work with and expand upon.\r\n\r\nThe Development documentation can be found [here](http://harveyhunt.github.io/seprcph/doxygen/html/index.html). It contains descriptions of all classes, methods etc.\r\nIt was auto-generated using [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/).\r\n\r\n### User Manual\r\nThe user manual for the game will be available as a PDF file here once the game has reached Version 1.0. It will also be included in the GitHub repository. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTeam CPH consisted of @HarveyHunt, @FlinnBurgess, @pmb516, @EthanLaBonche, @hwjj500, and @al502. It will be extended by another team (yet to be discovered/revealed/decided/foretold/written in blood across a wall).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
